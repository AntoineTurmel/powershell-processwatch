# powershell-processwatch
Monitor the start/exit of a process with notification on exit

Based of https://www.faqforge.com/windows/monitor-processes-with-windows-powershell/ and using [BurntToast](https://github.com/Windos/BurntToast)

The .vbs script can be used to avoid PowerShell window to open, you can schedule it on startup with the Windows Scheduled Tasks service.

I mainly use this to monitor closing all Firefox.exe process.
